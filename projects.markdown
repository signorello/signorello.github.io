<p><strong>Ongoing Projects</strong></p>
<p><em>&rdquo;Myriarch: Framework for a multi-architecture Internet&rdquo; - </em>[3-year FCT grant, Mar. 2023 - Feb. 2026]</p>
<p><em>Role:</em> Local Coordinator &amp; Principal Investigator (PI) at NOVA University Lisbon&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /><em>Idea:</em> This project aims to develop a framework, Myriarch, that enables a multi-architecture Internet. Myriarch will enable the inter-operation of old and novel architectures, to each evolve separately, leaving to applications the choice of the best for their needs. Myriarch will guarantee the required Internet-scale network performance, a crucial requirement for deployability, by building the required inter-networking mechanisms into programmable network hardware (including programmable switching ASICs) and performant packet-processing software (NFV).</p>
<p><em>Research activities:</em> I do research on the general design of the architectural framework, the design of Myriarch&rsquo;s translation mechanisms at the data plane level, the integration and the evaluation of the framework into the project&rsquo;s proposed use-cases (SCION and NDN Internet architectures).</p>
