I currently work as an assistant professor at the Computer Science department of the NOVA University Lisbon. I am also a member of the NOVA Laboratory for Computer Science and Informatics (NOVA LINCS) research center.</span></td>

I am broadly interested in protocols and architectures for networked systems. Most of my current research primarily centers on the use of programmable network technologies for network monitoring and network security applications. I am also very interested in the topic of reproducibility in computer science research, since 2020 I have been actively involved in assisting with artifact evaluation processes at conferences related to systems, networks, and security. 

Before joining NOVA University Lisbon, I worked as a research scientist at Telefonica Research in Barcelona from 2023 to 2024. Prior to this role, I served as an invited assistant professor at the Department of Informatics (DI) of the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon (FCUL) from 2021 to 2023 and as a postdoctoral researcher at FCUL and INESC-ID/IST in Lisbon from 2018 to 2021. I hold a PhD in Computer Science jointly from the Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT) in Luxembourg and the INRIA-Nancy Lab in France, and an MSc. and a BSc. in Computer Science and Information Engineering from Italy.
