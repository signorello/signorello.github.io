I have finally decided to launch my website to make my teaching and research activities more publicly visible. I sincerely apologize to those who have repeatedly asked for or struggled to find this website in the past; I know this has been long overdue. Moving forward, I plan to provide regular updates about my teaching and research activities through this platform :)

The latest news is that, as of February 2025, I have joined the Department of Computer Science at NOVA University Lisbon as an assistant professor, [see the news here][contract-news], and I am again based in Lisbon, Portugal. My contact and office information at NOVA is available [here][nova-contact].
